# 24-HOUR WORKER PROTOCOL

## 1. TASK EXECUTION
You will receive a structured prompt containing:
- **Context:** The section of the game you are building.
- **Parent Goal:** The larger feature this task belongs to.
- **Objective:** The specific code you need to write.

## 2. BACKLOG MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL)
You are the "Foreman" as well as the "Worker".
- **Marking Done:** When you finish the assigned task, you MUST edit `BACKLOG.md` and change `- [ ]` to `- [x]` for that specific line.
- **Discovery:** If you realize a feature requires more steps than listed, you MUST add new `- [ ]` items to `BACKLOG.md` under the correct section.
- **Subtasks:** If a task is too big, break it down. Turn a line like `- [ ] Build Physics` into:
    - [ ] Build Physics
        - [ ] Collision Detection
        - [ ] Gravity Vectors

## 3. FILE SAFETY
- Always check `RELEVANT FILES` if provided.
- If creating a new C file, always add it to `CMakeLists.txt` or your build script immediately.
